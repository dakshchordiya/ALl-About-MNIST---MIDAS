 **Downloading Data.ipynb** : Script to download the data to the google drive from the urls. 

# *Task-1* : Scripts for Part-1. <br /><br />

   **Experimentation_with_CNN_Architectures.ipynb** : Script to get the best Model Architecture for the given dataset. It experiments with various Model Architectures and selcts the best Architecture using the Brute Force. <br />
  
   **Task 1.ipynb** : Script to train a Model on the Dataset provided using the Architecture derived from *Experimentation_with_CNN_Architectures.ipynb* <br />
  
   **train_ckpt** : Model Checkpoints for Part-1. <br /><br /> 
   
   
   # *Task-2* : Scripts for Part-2. <br /><br />

   **Training 0-9\Train0-9.ipynb** : Script to train the Model from Task-1 on Dataset with 0-9 digits from dataset from Part-1 <br />
  
   **Transfer_Learning_and_Fresh_Learning_Model_Training.ipynb** : Script to Compare and Analyse results from Transfer learning from the model trained in *Training 0-9\Train0-9.ipynb* and a freshly trained Model.  <br />
  
   **Training 0-9\train_ckpt** : Model Checkpoints for all Models in Part-2. <br /><br /> 
  
  
  # *Task-3* : Scripts for Part-3. <br /><br />

   **Pretrained_vs_Scratch.ipynb** : Script to Compare and Analyse results from Transfer learning from the model trained in *Task-2\Training 0-9\Train0-9.ipynb* and a freshly trained Model. <br />
  
   **train_ckpt** : Model Checkpoints for Part-3. <br /><br />
